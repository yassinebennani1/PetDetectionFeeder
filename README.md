## Project Summary

Autonomous pet feeder that uses ARM Mbed and Raspberry Pi 3. This feeder dispenses 2 different types of pet food for 2 different species of pets and water into a water bowl. Using a Raspberry Pi Camera, the Raspberry Pi runs image recognition using OpenCV to detect when a pet is in front of the feeder. After determining the pet, the Pi sends a signal to the Mbed to dispense the corresponding food and water into the bowls. The Mbed uses force sensitive resistor (FSR) and water level sensors to stop dispensing when the bowls are full.
